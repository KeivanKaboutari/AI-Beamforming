MATLAB codes using the FT-based method, omitting the magnitude information, applying optimization, and AI methods are developed.
The main code to use other subfunctions are "mainFunctionSingleBeamAtDifferentDirections.m", "mainFunctionSingleBeamAtDifferentDirectionsForOneDirection", and "mainFunctionMultiBeamAtDeterminedDirections.m".
The first two m-files are developed to simulate a case, including just one main beam. However, the third one generates and simulates cases with more than one main beam. Note that for using the developed codes on your workstations/servers, you must change the paths in the code regarding your destination.
