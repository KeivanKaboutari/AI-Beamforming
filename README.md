# AI-Beamforming
MATLAB codes to beam steering using FT-based method and optimization by omitting the magnitude information
The main code to use other subfunctions are "mainFunctionSingleBeamAtDifferentDirections.m" and "mainFunctionMultiBeamAtDeterminedDirections.m".
The first one is used to simulated a case including just one main beam. However, the second one is used to generate and simulate cases with more than one main beam.
